# Development Session 001

## Session Information
- **Session ID**: session-001
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Duration**: 1.5 hours
- **Developer**: Claude Code

## Session Objectives
- [x] Analyze existing ENARM Prep codebase
- [x] Create comprehensive CLAUDE.md documentation
- [x] Set up session management infrastructure
- [x] Establish progressive development workflow

## Work Completed
### Files Modified/Created
- `CLAUDE.md` - Created comprehensive development guide with architecture overview
- `.claude/session-state.json` - Created session state tracking system
- `.claude/session-template.md` - Created template for future session documentation
- `.claude/sessions/session-001.md` - Current session documentation

### Features Implemented
- Session state management system for progressive development
- Comprehensive documentation covering architecture, patterns, and workflows
- Template-based session tracking system

### Architecture Understanding
- Analyzed vanilla JavaScript modular architecture (ENARMApp, QuestionManager, ProgressManager)
- Documented PWA implementation with Service Worker
- Identified CSS custom properties theming system
- Mapped out single-page application navigation pattern

## Current State
### What's Working
- Complete codebase analysis and documentation
- Session management infrastructure established
- Clear development workflow defined
- Progressive development system ready for use

### Known Issues
- None identified during initial setup
- Medical content accuracy needs validation for any future question additions

### In Progress
- Testing of session workflow (to be completed in next session)

## Next Session Priorities
1. **High Priority**: Test `/init` and `/end` workflow to ensure session continuity works
2. **Medium Priority**: Consider adding development tools (linting, formatting guidelines)
3. **Low Priority**: Document additional medical content standards if needed

## Technical Notes
### Architecture Changes
- Added `.claude/` directory structure for session management
- No changes to existing application architecture
- Maintained compatibility with existing development workflow

### Dependencies
- No new dependencies added
- Existing Chart.js and Service Worker dependencies documented

### Testing
- [ ] Manual testing of session workflow needed
- [ ] Verify session state persistence
- [ ] Test template usage
- [x] Documentation completeness validated

## Session Handoff Notes
The session management infrastructure is now complete and ready for use. The system provides:

1. **Session State Tracking**: JSON file tracks project status, completed tasks, current focus, and technical state
2. **Template System**: Standardized format for documenting each development session
3. **Progressive Workflow**: Clear `/init` and `/end` commands for session continuity
4. **Best Practices**: Documented guidelines for maintaining development momentum across sessions

Next developer should test the workflow by running `/init` command and verify that session state is properly read and TodoWrite is populated with appropriate tasks.

## Commit Status
- [x] All changes committed
- [x] Session state updated
- [x] Documentation updated

**Ready for progressive development workflow implementation.**
